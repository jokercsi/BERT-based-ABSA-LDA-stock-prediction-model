            "Top5ThingstoWatchinMarketsintheWeekAheadBy Daniel ShvartsmanInvesting.com - Markets started September on a strong note, with the S&P 500 closing up 3.4% in the first full week of the month and the NASDAQ Composite jumping 4.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed only 2.4%. Whether that was just a market positioning adjustment or the sign of anything more sustained will be on watch this week, especially as a new set of inflation reports comes out. Corporate news is on the lighter side, though some big earnings reports and a rare major IPO are on the docket for the week ahead. This weekend served as a reminder of the ongoing and changing nature of the Russia-Ukraine war, and while the recent developments may not have a direct market impact, the repercussions could certainly reverberate through the financial world.Here's what you need to know for the week ahead in financial markets:A bevy of consumer price index (CPI) reports for August come out this week. India releases its CPI report on Monday, Germany, Spain, and the U.S. all release on Tuesday, the U.K. releases its report on Wednesday, France releases its report on Thursday, and Italy and the Eurozone as a whole release theirs on Friday.Producer Price Index (PPI) reports are also due out from Japan, Switzerland (Tuesday), the U.K. (Wednesday), and the U.S. The expectations are for inflation to be easing in the U.S., with month over month Core CPI expected at 0.3%, matching last month’s number; this would mark the lowest back-to-back readings since last fall. Headline CPI is expected to be -0.1%, as dropping gas prices continue to take pressure off inflation. Core PPI is expected to be 0.3%, a rise from last month’s 0.2%, while the headline PPI number is also expected to be -0.1%.Those expectations are quite different in Europe; the U.K. is forecast to see core CPI month over month growth of 0.8%, a significant jump, while headline CPI is expected to jump another 0.6%. The Eurozone is forecast to see a 0.5% rise in the core CPI number, a jump from last month’s revised figure of 0.1%. The same is expected of headline CPI, as energy prices still loom large with the seasons changing.The ECB has already made its latest move, hiking interest rates by 75 basis points last week. The Fed is expected to stick to at least a 50 basis points hike if not 75, and the inflation reports are not expected to shake it, but no doubt Chair Jerome Powell would welcome signs that inflation is at least moderating meaningfully.The Bank of England, whose meeting was due this week but postponed in the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, faces a more fluctuating environment with new Prime Minister Liz Truss in charge and already having issued a major energy plan. Its effect on the market is among the things the BOE will have to weigh; it will also get an employment report as an additional piece of data to throw into the mix.While Q2 earnings season has just about played itself out, there are two key software companies reporting results that are worth watching.Software giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) reports Monday after the close, and is expected to show 4% earnings growth in its first quarter including newest acquisition Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN). Oracle received a recent price target upgrade from a Global Equities analyst in light of the Cerner deal, as well as a buy rating from Guggenheim, but like many in the software and tech industry, has been adjusting to a more difficult macro environment, as the company has been reported to have started lay-offs. So the earnings report and conference call may be revealing.Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reports Thursday after the market close. The company is expected to post 7.3% earnings growth and 12.6% revenue growth. A Jefferies analyst warned that the company hasn’t adjusted guidance for macro headwinds, only forex effects, so there could be more room to disappoint. The company disappointed in its prior report but the share price has since more than recovered. Adobe’s role as one of the original software companies that transitioned successfully to a SaaS (software as a service) model makes its report a useful bellwether.2022’s volatile trading has left the IPO market as a casualty, with most IPOs that have made it to market being of the thinly traded, relatively obscure type. Corebridge Financial is a spin-off from AIG (NYSE:AIG) but will come to market via an IPO rather than a direct issuing to AIG shareholders. It focuses on retirement solutions and insurance plans. The company is due to start trading on Thursday, and seeks to raise $1.68-$1.92B before factoring in fees or underwriter share purchases, vs. a valuation range of $13.6-$15.6B.Read more about the IPO here: 7 Things to Know About the Corebridge Financial IPOWith the summer over and earnings season in its quietest moments, many companies are hitting the road to meet with investors. Investor conferences and presentations often feature strategic updates and announcements, shifts in sell-side analyst and market thinking, and even dealmaking.A few notable conferences or analyst days this week:Goldman Sachs Communicopia + Technology Conference, featuring companies such as:  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB), Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), Dynatrace (NYSE:DT), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL),  Airbnb Inc  (NASDAQ:ABNB),  Snowflake Inc  (NYSE:SNOW), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and Visa (NYSE:V)Morgan Stanley 20th Annual Global Healthcare Conference, featuring companies like  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL), Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK),  Bausch + Lomb  Corp (NYSE:BLCO),  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Insulet (NASDAQ:PODD), and Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX).Barclays) Global Financial Services Conference, featuring Cboe Global Markets Inc (NYSE:CBOE), US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Allstate (NYSE:ALL), and Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), among other companies.On the analyst days front, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Workiva (NYSE:WK),  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) all have investor or analyst days on Tuesday, with Starbucks especially in close watch given the appointment of its new CEO recently.Ukraine’s surprising recapture of the city of Izium in the country’s northeast has caught observers' attention around the world as a potential turning point in the war. Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions in the south of the country, near Kherson, and should they be able to maintain an attack on two fronts and take and hold territory, it would mark a different tone.Russia has continued to escalate economic pressure on Europe with the shutting down of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. While the military landscape is shifting and uncertain, it is not hard to imagine that Russian setbacks could only increase Russia’s willingness to use its economic leverage with Ukraine and with Ukraine’s supporters in predictable and unpredictable ways, which could put more pressure on European countries to resolve their energy situation before the winter arrives, and which makes the inflation reports mentioned at the top of the article all the more relevant. \n",
            "UkraineandRussia:Whatyouneedtoknowrightnow(Reuters) - Ukraine accused Russian forces of attacking civilian infrastructure in response to a rapid weekend offensive by Ukrainian troops that drove Russia to abandon its main bastion in the Kharkiv region. FIGHTING* Ukrainian forces have advanced north from Kharkiv to within 50km (30 miles) of the border with Russia and are also pressing to the south and east in the same region, Ukrainian chief commander General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said.* Zaluzhnyi said Ukraine has retaken more than 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) this month. * Britain's Defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had continued making gains in the Kharkiv region over the past 24 hours, with Russia likely withdrawing units but fighting continuing around the cities of Kupiansk and Izium.* Russia's defence ministry ordered troops to leave the area around the city of Izium, TASS reported on Saturday. It also quoted Russian-installed chief administrator of Russian-controlled parts of the province as telling residents to evacuate to Russia.* Russian nationalists called angrily for President Vladimir Putin to make immediate changes to ensure ultimate victory in the Ukraine war, after Moscow was forced to abandon its main bastion in northeastern Ukraine.* Ukraine needs to secure the territory it has recaptured from Russian forces against a possible counterattack, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov was quoted as saying on Sunday. Ukrainian troops were tired after their six-day offensive but morale was good, he told the Financial Times.* Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports.NUCLEAR PLANT* Operations at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have been fully stopped as a safety measure, its state operator said. The move followed the restoration of the backup power line allowing to connect the plant with Ukraine's electricity grid.* The IAEA nuclear watchdog confirmed the restoration of the line, allowing the plant to take power needed from the grid to cool its reactors.* The presidents of Russia and France held talks regarding safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with Putin blaming Ukrainian forces while Emmanuel Macron pointed the finger at Russian troops.DIPLOMACY, TRADE* Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told a conference attended by Germany’s foreign minister that Russia was doing “everything” to break Ukrainian and European resolve this winter. “Ninety days that more than all other years will determine the existence of the EU,” he said in remarks posted on his website late on Saturday.* Britain dismissed Putin's assertion that only a tiny fraction of grain exported from Ukraine under an international deal was going to poor countries, saying 30% has gone to low and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.* France's transport minister said he would sign an agreement with Romania to help increase Ukrainian grain exports to developing countries including to the Mediterranean.  \n",

            "Energy&PreciousMetals-WeeklyReviewandOutlookBy Barani KrishnanInvesting.com - Let’s take a moment to say a prayer in memory of all of those who gave their lives on this fateful day 21 years ago. To the victims of 9/11, you live on in our hearts.Thank you. Now, back to the business of energy and precious metals and the week that was. For those surprised with how much gasoline prices had fallen at the pump since the height of summer demand — from a record $5.01 a gallon in mid-June to below $3.50 in several spots in the U.S. East Coast this weekend — here’s some news: Those prices could fall further.John Treanor, a spokesman at the American Automobile Association, told Salt Lake City, Utah-based station KSL-TV that the price at the pump is expected to drop even more as we head into colder months. Treanor said customers could see a decrease of 7 to 10 cents per gallon when gas switches from a summer blend to a winter blend.\"In the winter months, what's called the Reid Vapor Pressure — it's a gauge that the EPA uses to regulate how much emissions your fuel can have — changes. In the winter months that range can be higher,\" Treanor said. The EPA refers to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is tasked with environmental protection matters.While the forthcoming fuel blend switch at the pump may be even friendlier to consumers’ wallets, the drawback might be a slight hit to the environment — in terms of air quality, that is. EPA regulations passed in 1990 allow more butane in gas during winter months and that makes the gas less expensive.\"That means you can put more butane in,” said Treanor, explaining. “Butane is essentially a filler there. It helps your fuel burn a little faster, burn a little hotter, but it does cause more vapor.”Treanor’s remarks come after comments by Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, who told TheStreet a few weeks ago that prices in a few states could even drop below $3 soon. The states most likely to benefit from such a steep dip would be Texas, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Kentucky.Such a circumstance would put prices lower than this time last year, when the national average was $3.18 for regular unleaded, based on AAA figures.Pump prices are primarily determined by the price of crude oil, which varies based on supply, consumer demand and other factors. Taxes also play into prices, and many states have enacted “gas tax holidays” this summer to help consumers fill their tanks.Leaving taxes aside, let’s look at the price of crude first. From its March 7 peak of $139.13 a barrel two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine and the start of Western sanctions on Russia that caused the global upheaval of commodities, Brent hit a seven-month low of $87.25 in the just-ended week. While it ended the week higher at $92.84 a barrel, it was still down some $46, or 33%, from its March peak.U.S. crude’s West Texas Intermediate benchmark, hit a seven-month low of $81.20 per barrel but settled the week at $86.79. That was still down almost $44, or 34%, from its March 7 peak of $130.50.Demand-wise, U.S. crude stockpile numbers have been quite volatile in recent months, though leaning bearish of late.Crude oil inventories rose by 8.844 million last week, the highest for a week since the week ended April 8, when there was a build of 9.382 million. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a crude drawdown of 250,000 barrels instead for last week. The crude build indicated weakening demand for fuels with the winding down of the peak summer travel period.Inventories of gasoline, America’s top automobile fuel, climbed by a modest 333,000 barrels against expectations for a draw of 1.667 million barrels.Stocks of distillates — the oil variant required for making the diesel needed for trucks, buses and trains, as well as the fuel for jets — rose by 95,000 barrels, less than the rise of 530,000 that had been expected. Exports of U.S. crude, another important component of the weekly data, slowed to 3.433 million barrels per day (bpd) last week from the prior week’s 3.967 million bpd.But analysts — especially oil bulls — contend that statistics on crude have been messed up by the release of tens of million barrels from the U.S. emergency stockpile, or Strategic Petroleum Reserve, known as the SPR. The SPR again saw a large outflow of 7.5 million barrels last week that brought the stockpile there to 442.5 million — its lowest since November 1984. The Biden administration has been drawing down the SPR since November 2021 to make up the shortfall in crude supply on the domestic market for fuels. But outflows from the reserve really accelerated in May when the administration embarked on a battle to bring down the spiraling pump price of gasoline that had bumped US inflation to 40-year highs. The president has committed to draw down 180 million barrels from the reserve over a six-month period — or roughly one million barrels per day — between May and October.  At latest count, the SPR had released a total of 173.8 million barrels since March, a figure that includes volumes associated with an earlier round of tenders, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.Which brings us to the question of what happens after October. Those long oil are betting the house that post-October, when excess crude hanging over the market clears, the WTI price for a barrel would shoot back to above $100 — with Brent fetching about $10 more than whatever the U.S. benchmark does.This week, it appeared initially that the Biden administration might hamper those bets when Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Reuters in an interview that the SPR drawdowns might be extended beyond October. But White House officials, speaking anonymously, told CNN later that there were no plans as of now to continue with SPR withdrawals after October.Besides the end of SPR drawdowns, oil bulls might benefit from the increasingly bellicose position of Russian President Vladimir Putin towards the West for its ever-tightening sanctions against his country. Furious with the latest G7-endorsed cap on the selling price of Russian oil, Putin is eager to hit back and hurt the U.S. and its allies in the most painful way possible. His plan, which almost everyone other than probably his gardener knew from day one, is to shut all oil and gas supplies to the world. Such action would presumably send oil prices spiraling back to high $100s. But some analysts say the global economy, especially Europe’s, is almost certain to go into an unmitigated recession in such a case, and that could bring energy prices back down. Also, some meteorologists are cautioning that a warmer-than-usual start to the 2022/23 winter could result in more surprises for oil bulls.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced that there was a 91% chance that La Niña conditions would stay in place through November with a 53% chance of La Niña continuing through March 2023. During the winter, La Niña events typically bring warmer and drier weather to North Texas. Warmer than normal waters in the Gulf of Mexico can help increase the warmth of the air and moisture content, fueling strong storms.There’s just no easy way out for either side on this.U.S. crude’s WTI did a final trade of $86.10, after settling Friday’s official session up $3.35, or 3.9%, at $86.79 per barrel. For the week, WTI was off by just 8 cents or less than 0.1%. Prior to the rebound, it hit a seven-month low of $81.20 this week, pulverized by new Covid-19 lockdowns in top oil importer China.London-traded Brent, which serves as the global benchmark for oil, did a final trade of $92.42 after settling the official session up $3.69, or 4.1%, at $92.84.  For the week, it was off by 18 cents or 0.2%. Prior to the rebound, Brent hit a seven-month low of $87.25 this week.WTI continues to remain bearish for the fourth month in a row and for more than ten weeks, with WTI settling below the weekly middle Bollinger Band, noted SKCharting.com’s chief technical strategist Sunil Kumar Dixit.Weekly stochastics have been struggling to rebel out of long oversold territories, Dixit said, although he added that this week’s drop to $81.20 witnessed some resilience as prices rebounded from the monthly middle Bollinger Band of $82.50.“A short-term rebound towards the daily middle Bollinger Band of $89.40 is a high probability,” Dixit said.“If WTI makes a sustained break above a swing high of $90.40, we expect a further upside towards the 50 Week EMA of $92.35 and the 50 Day EMA of $93.90 followed by the 200 Day SMA $96.40,” he said, referring to the Exponential Moving Average and Simple Moving Average, respectively.But he said the risk of a further drop wasn’t over yet, either. “On the downside, weakness below $82.50 will call for a drop to the 100-Week SMA of $76.70,” Dixit said. “However, bears may prefer to wait for better positioning, when prices approach the 200-Day SMA of $96.40, before pulling the trigger.”Gold had its first weekly gain in four as the dollar retreated further on Friday from its biggest rally in two decades, allowing bullion to somewhat reinforce its standing as a safe haven.The benchmark gold futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,727.60 per ounce, after settling Friday’s official session up $8.40, or 0.8%, at $1,728.60. For the week, it gained 0.3% after a cumulative 5.2% loss over three previous weeks.The Dollar Index, which pits itself against six major currencies led by the euro, slid for the third day in a row, reaching a low of 108.35 from Wednesday’s 20-year high of 110.79. The greenback slid even as Federal Reserve officials pushed on Friday for another outsized rate hike to keep inflation down, when the central bank meets on Sept. 21.The spot price of bullion, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, was last traded at $1,717.62, up $9.03, or 0.5%.“Gold is higher as the historic run higher in the dollar appears to have run out of steam,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.  “It seems Wall Street is getting comfortable with the idea of another 75-basis point rate hike by the Fed.”SKCharting’s Dixit, who tracks spot gold instead of futures, said the risk of a further drop to the 200-Week SMA of $1,675 and the 50-Month EMA of $1,672 remain on the cards.“Gold's rebound attempts from $1,688 has witnessed a cautious approach from buyers as prices tested $1,730,” Dixit said. “Gold needs to break above or below the $1746-$1688 range of the previous week.”He referred to Tuesday’s scheduled release of the August Consumer Price Index as one that may have a major say in gold’s price move for the coming week. “In the short term, a sustained move above $1,712 indicates buying towards $1,728 and the 5-Day EMA of $1,732. A sustained break below $1,712 indicates sellers are pushing gold towards $1,705 and $1,700, below which $1,690 can be tested.”“Gold actually needs to clear the $1,750-$1,760 zone in order to reclaim the $1,800-$1,808 swing top.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.\n",

And they can move the markets, affecting the overall stock indices.Taken collectively, they are what we can, without a doubt, refer to as a financial behemoth, accounting for about 15% of the S&P 500.But every decade or so, everything shifts.Enter MATANA. Think of it as FAANG 2.0.MATANA, according to Constellation Research principal analyst Ray Wang, better represents the new world order of tech stocks. He has plucked Meta  – or the old Facebook – and Netflix out of the top tier of heavy hitters. And in their stead has elevated Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia.Hence:MicrosoftAppleTeslaAlphabetNvidiaAmazonHere are his arguments in favor of this re-ordering of the tech world’s elite class and why the new acronym might hold greater sway for the decade ahead.Meta (NASDAQ:META) (Facebook): Meta needs to define its plan, Wang said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.“Facebook has got to do something besides ads. Once again, they’re taking a beating for it. So, is it going to be the glasses? Is it going to be the metaverse? We're not there yet and that’s really kind of what the challenge is.”Meta Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX): The biggest question facing the streaming service, according to Wang: How many subscribers can it get?And that is the fundamental problem with its one-trick-pony business model. Growth could be limited if it is uniquely tied to its subscription model.Said Wang:“Product placement should be where they are, plus the ability to do (intellectual property) licensing. Look at how Disney makes its money.”Netflix Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT): According to Wang, the company has found a way to straddle key segments – what it provides corporate and consumer clients.Wang’s take:“They’re positioned well for the metaverse. They’re positioned well for the cloud and, of course, they’ve got their gaming business.”Microsoft Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA): Its growth potential lies with the continuously expanding need for microchips, but also in how it can play a big role in the emerging fields that could very well define the future.Said Wang: “Nvidia is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and more than the data center or gaming. They’re sitting at the edge between (artificial intelligence), the metaverse, the future of computing and the way they do their partnerships. They’re set up in a way that’s going to be dominant for quite some time.”Nvidia Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): The promotion into the acronym could settle a long-standing debate, confirmation that Tesla is not just a car company.Tesla Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comBut it is a car company, and in the less than 20 years since it was founded in 2003, it has disrupted the automotive sector.In 2021, Tesla was ranked as the most valuable automotive brand in the world. That same year, it was deemed the fastest growing brand on the planet. Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021.The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP. Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock.Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months.The company is expected to host another product launch event next month, where it is expected to show off its newest iPads and computers, which could trigger some movement in the stock price again.But one thing the latest Apple event sparked was a reaction for a much lesser known company – Globalstar Inc (NYSE:GSAT). The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications.The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service.The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77.Globalstar Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comThe initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality.Apple’s plans for the satellite service came with a plan to spend $450 million to support the feature, with Reuters reporting that a “majority” of that money is being funneled to Globalstar. This – on the surface – seemed like a big deal, given that Globalstar posted revenues last year that were less than a third of that amount. But the reality is that Globalstar will have to invest heavily in additional satellites to fulfill its deal to support the Apple service, according to reports.All to say, it will be worth watching how this unfolds. The new frontier is filled with opportunity, and having Apple on your side is a nice way to blaze a trail, or boldly go where no smartphones have gone before.On the S&P 500Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN): +24.78%SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG): +16.97%Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB): +15.57%Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL):15.24%Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc (NYSE:FCX).: +13.75%On the NASDAQ CompositeAmyris (NASDAQ:AMRS): +37.73%Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ:SAVA): 32.90%Pingtan Marine Enterprise (NASDAQ:PME): +26.08%Pacific Biosciences (NASDAQ:PACB): +25.75%Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT): +24.58%On the S&P 500Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY): -4.58%McCormick & Company Incorporated (NYSE:MKC): -3.80%Church & Dwight Company (NYSE:CHD): -3:11%CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF): -2.94%Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB): -2.79%On the NASDAQ CompositePlus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PSTV): -18.60%Newegg Commerce Inc (NASDAQ:NEGG): -16.78%Burcon NutraScience Corporation (NASDAQ:BRCN): -15.38%Cadiz Inc.

            "WeekAhead:StocksSetToResumeCorrectiveRallyOnTechnicalsWill investors maintain last week's return to risk as the Federal Reserve pushes its liquidation pedal harder this month? Investors will find that both stocks and bonds become heavier as the dollar supply shrinks, and given that the economy is already in a downturn, continued tightening increases the chances for a recession even the Biden Administration will find it difficult to deny.All four major U.S. averages gained for the first week in four, erasing the previous week's losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 4.9%. However, in terms of the decline from the week that started Aug. 15, the S&P 500 Index is beating its peers, down only 5%, paring the 8.3% decline as of the previous week. Conversely, the two worst performers remain the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 7.2% and 6.7%, respectively. This market paradigm is rational. Those last two are the most vulnerable when rates are on the rise. Investors are rotating out of big tech, which has maximized its return potential. They are dumping small companies, who don't have the resources and flexibility to deal with a tightening economy as large caps do.Let's dig deeper. Let's analyze the S&P 500 sectors. Consumer Discretionary surged 5.8%, the clear winner. However, in every other time frame: month, three months, six months, year to date, and yearly, Communication Services and its split conjoined twin, Technology, underperformed.But why will Technology outperform last week? Because the market flipped. The most stretched snapped back the hardest. Also, the dollar fell for the first week in four, after reaching a 20-year high and reaching levels against the yen not seen in 24 years. That 100% negative correlation is either a coincidence or causal.Given that a stronger dollar hurts American exports and foreign investments, there's reason to believe that a stronger dollar for the first three weeks weighed on equities and the weak dollar last week relieved that pressure. So, why would the dollar fall? Fedspeak was consistently pro further jump hikes, and rhetoric reiterated that inflation is still going strong and that policymakers will keep going for as long as necessary until they force inflation back down. In other words, there is no known fundamental reason for the dollar to back down, suggesting it declines in its haven status as investors increase risk.If there is no known fundamental reason, let's check out technical ones.SentimentThe sentiment indicator, the Levkovich Index - previously known as Citi's Panic/Euphoria model - dropped last week to 16, just one notch away from 17, considered a panic level. Bank of America's bull-and-bear gauge dropped to \"maximum bearish,\" egging on contrarian investors.Support and ResistanceSupport and resistance are functions of supply and demand. Chartists who follow trend lines create a self-fulfilled prophecy. Even fundamental analysts are humans. They remember that the price behaved in a certain way at a certain level, and that may influence an analyst's decision-making process.The following study of support and resistance I show you will probably represent the first time I have used it since the beginning of writing this column five and a half years and 2,313 articles ago - the Fibonacci indicator. I don't incorporate it into my analysis because I don't understand it. This mathematical sequence is found in many aspects of nature, and technicians, therefore, expect that it will also impact humans. I show it this time because it appears to be affecting the S&P 500 Index - consistently.S&P 500 Daily ChartSource: Investing.comThe bounce from the mid-June low to the mid-August high retraced to the 0.618 Fibonacci sequences (which coincided with the downtrend line), and last week's bounce retracted - that's right - from the 0.618 level. This measure is presumed to be the largest corrective move. If the price breaches it, the odds rise for a reversal. Interestingly, it may be a coincidence, but the gauge worked for the same level both ways. Perhaps Fibonacci followers are driving these moves. I have no other rational explanation.Either way, the price gapped above the 50- and 100-day moving averages, giving bulls an edge, suggesting the price has room for a further corrective rally to the downtrend line, reinforced with the 200 DMA. Still, you'd be going against the primary trend, which is risky.The dollar has fallen for three straight days for the first time in nearly a month, as some traders question whether the future hikes are already priced into the U.S. currency at a two-decade high. So, despite hawkish Fedspeak, this could be another reason why equities rally: the outlook of a weaker dollar. Let's look at the technicals.Dollar Index Daily ChartSource: Investing.comThe dollar is still very much in an uptrend. We can see how far it rose above its uptrend line, increasing the chances for a pullback. However, note that the greenback closed well off its lows on Friday, having found support by the July 14 high. Still, there is room for concern. Both the moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) and the relative strength index (RSI) indicators triggered negative correlations, increasing the chances for a further drop. Both also provided bearish crosses. However, as aforementioned, the dollar is still in an uptrend and has room for correction, having risen far away from its uptrend line.Gold bounced last week, in a mirror image of the dollar, having neared not its previous July low but the lowest levels since April 2020. However, the chart signals a warning.Gold Futures Daily ChartSource: Investing.comGold might be forming a second consecutive rising flag, bearish after the preceding $80, in a straight five-day line down - the telltale sign of a rising flag. A downside breakout will imply an $80 target. Note how both flags formed precisely on the downtrend line, with which the price has struggled since August.Gold Futures Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comIf that scenario follows through, gold will have breached its two-and-a-half-year support, topping out, implying another $400 drop.In another show of correlation with risk, rather than haven, assets, Bitcoin jumped 8.8% in its first rise in four weeks.Bitcoin Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comThe price found resistance by the bottom of a failed rising channel, as the 200-week MA pierced through it, which bumped head with the main falling channel. The 50-week MA fell below the 100 WMA. BTC is set to extend another down toward testing the 2020 lows.Oil rose Friday for the second straight day but was still down for the second week, closing weekly at the lowest since the week beginning Jan. 17.Crude Oil WTI Futures Daily ChartSource: Investing.comAfter completing a descending triangle, coinciding with a weekly death cross (when the 50 WMA falls below the 200 WMA, showing how pricing is breaking down broadly), the price bounced off the bottom of a falling channel, implying a continued spiral to $60 and below.Disclaimer: At the time of publication, the author had no positions in the securities mentioned.***Looking to get up to speed on your next idea?

            "StocksFaceFurtherLossesAsRatesSurgeYields have rocketed higher, and stocks have failed to keep pace with the surge. So despite the recent plunge in equity prices, indexes like the S&P 500 are more expensive today relative to bonds than before stock prices fell. It doesn't make one feel good now, does it?Looking at the spread between the S&P 500's earnings yield over the trailing twelve months and the current 10-year Treasury rate shows that the spread has contracted. That spread is now around 1.84% and the significantly lower end of its historical range of the past ten years.S&P/10-Year Yield SpreadEven more shocking is that the index has fallen by more than 8% since Aug. 16, yet the spread between the earnings yield and the 10-year is lower. In August, that spread was at 1.93%, which tells us that stocks today are more overvalued relative to bonds due to the speed at which yields have increased.On Aug.16, the 10-year rate was around 2.75%; now, it is trading around 3.3%, a massive move in a brief period. This would tell us that despite the sharp decline in the equity market, stocks haven't fully priced in higher yields and that stocks still need to fall further to account for the move higher in rates.S&P/10-Year Yield SpreadHow much lower should stocks fall, of course, becomes the next question. For that, we can turn and look at where the spreads were in June and July, and at that time, they were between 2.2% and 2.6%, and if we take the middle of 2.4%, stocks would need to reflect an earnings yield that is about 50 bps higher than today, assuming the 10-year rate is unchanged.That would push the earnings yield on the S&P 500 from around 5.15% today to about 5.65%, pushing the PE ratio from 19.4 to 17.7. Assuming earnings over the last twelve months of $204.91 would knock the value of the S&P 500 to 3,626 from its current 3,975, or a drop of about 9%.S&P Earnings YieldThe stocks that could get hurt the most in such a decline would be those that have seen their valuations rise or fall due to rates thus far. That would be stocks in the growth sector and many technology stocks or stocks that continue to carry high valuations in general.It seems easy to see that despite stocks falling since Jay Powell's Jackson Hole speech, the Fed isn't going to back off tightening monetary policy anytime soon. That should make stocks worth less versus bonds and not worth more. Given the enormous move in yields, one would expect stocks to reprice along with bonds, especially since the Fed has proven it will be more aggressive than the stock market had anticipated.Disclaimer: Charts used with the permission of Bloomberg Finance LP.

            "Japanliquorbusinessesturntonon-alcoholicdrinkstoattractGenZBy Irene Wang and Tom BatemanTOKYO (Reuters) -Bucking the age-old stereotype of hard-drinking college students, Manaka Okamoto considers the next day's schedule before cracking open an alcoholic beverage.\"If I have to get up early, and I think 'Oh, I should hold off on drinking,' then I go for a non-alcohol drink to get a sense of alcohol when I'm drinking alone,\" Okamoto, 22, said at a Tokyo restaurant. \"And of course, when hanging out with friends who don't drink, it's nice to have something to toast with.\"  The popularity of low- and non-alcoholic drinks has risen worldwide, accelerated by the pandemic, which led many people to be more health conscious. The global market value for the segment rose to just under $10 billion in 2021 from $7.8 billion in 2018, according to researcher IWSR. The effect has been especially pronounced in Japan, where the population is shrinking and younger people drink far less than in previous decades. Just 7.8% of Japanese people in their 20s were regular drinkers in 2019 compared with 20.3% of that age group in 1999, according to government surveys. Facing a steady decline in revenue from alcohol sales, Japan's tax office in July launched a contest seeking ideas on how to stimulate demand among younger people. Japan's major drinks makers are also looking outside the country for growth. The chief of domestic beer leader Asahi Group Holdings told Reuters last month he saw North America as a key market. Suntory Holdings Group is looking to expand its canned cocktail business there.At home, the companies are coming up with new ways to improve the bar experience for non-drinkers.On a recent afternoon in the entertainment district of Roppongi, groups of mostly young women gathered at a no-alcohol \"beer garden\" set up in the shadow of one of Tokyo's tallest buildings.Beer gardens are a summer tradition in Japan, but this one - promoted by Suntory and broadcaster TV Asahi - skipped the beer, offering patrons a lineup of mocktails and non-alcohol wine instead. \"Consumers are not enjoying just alcoholic beverages. We think they value more of the communication that's generated when drinking or would like to enjoy the atmosphere of the place where they drink,\" said Suntory general manager Masako Koura. Competitor Kirin Holdings Co also offers non-alcoholic wines, cocktails and beer. The company said sales of its booze-free beer were up more than two-fold in the three months through June compared with a year ago. Sapporo Holdings Ltd said domestic sales of low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer rose 20% in the half year through June, while canned beer sales slid 4%.In Shibuya, the newly opened Sumadori Bar - a play on the Japanese words for \"smart drinking\" - offers elaborate, sugary cocktails that can be made with no alcohol or up to 3%. It offers an environment where everyone can enjoy a drink together, said Mizuho Kajiura, chief executive of the Asahi-led venture. Kajiura worked for two years in Indonesia and said his experience in the mostly Muslim nation gave him an appreciation for creating hospitable environments for non-drinkers.\"The aim of this bar is to value customers who cannot drink so that they can happily come here with people who do drink,\" Kajiura said. \"If other restaurants and bars can understand our aim, I think they would get more customers.\" \n",

            "DisneyCEOlaysoutearlyplanfordigitalfutureBy Dawn Chmielewski(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co on Sunday sketched the contours of a plan for how the entertainment, theme parks and consumer products conglomerate will use technology to enhance storytelling for the next 100 years.Speaking backstage at the company's biennial D23 Expo fan convention with Reuters, Chief Executive Bob Chapek took great pains to avoid what he called the \"M-word,\" or metaverse, despite pushing the company in that direction last year.Chapek described Disney's vision for the metaverse as \"next-generation storytelling.\" He wants to use data gleaned from theme park visits and consumers' streaming habits to deliver personalized entertainment experiences, including from the company's Marvel and Lucasfilm studios.\"Disney is absolutely a lifestyle,\" he told Reuters on Sunday in an interview at the convention in Anaheim, Calif. \"The question is, how is our next-gen storytelling leveraging what we know about a guest uniquely in this Disney lifestyle, then serving up unique experiences.\"Entertainment and technology companies rushed to secure a position in the metaverse after Meta Platforms Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the future of his company would be devoted to creating a robust, three-dimensional, persisitent environment where users’ digital avatars would work, hang out and pursue their hobbies.Well ahead of Meta's announcement, Chapek, who oversaw the parks division before taking over the top job in 2020, has spent years preparing how to extend the theme park experience to people who will never visit one of the company's six theme parks globally.Disney started laying the groundwork in earnest to explore new forms of storytelling over the past year, as it appointed veteran media and tech executive, Mike White, to oversee the newly created Next Generation Storytelling and Consumer Experiences unit. White has been charged with assembling the technological toolkit for Disney's creative executives to employ. He has also been brainstorming ideas for using augmented reality and other technologies to bring a new dimension to storytelling. Chapek cited one early example - an eight-minute augmented reality film that premiered this week on Disney+. \"This could be a real big catalyst for what's going to show up there and, you know, five to 10 years,\" said Chapek.  \n",

            "AmgensaysLumakrascutsriskoflungcancerprogressionby34%By Deena Beasley(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN)'s Lumakras pill reduced the risk of disease progression in patients with advanced lung cancer by 34% compared with chemotherapy in a clinical trial, the company said on Sunday.There was no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatments in the confirmatory study required by U.S. regulators as a condition of accelerated approval for Lumakras. But Amgen said the trial was not designed to detect a survival difference.The company is also testing whether the drug could be effective against lung cancer earlier in the disease, and said last month a small study of Lumakras combined with immunotherapy found high rates of liver toxicity and that further study was needed.More detailed results from the 345-patient study, including median progression-free survival - the length of time until the cancer begins to worsen - will be presented on Monday at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Paris.Wall Street analysts, such as Michael Yee at Jefferies, have said investors expect a modest benefit of around two months for the Amgen drug over chemotherapy.Amgen said 33% of Lumakras trial patients experienced serious side effects such as diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes, compared with 40% of chemotherapy patients.The medication is designed to target a mutated form of a gene known as KRAS that occurs in about 13% of non-small cell lung cancers, the most common form of the disease, and less frequently in some other solid tumors.\"We are offering the choice of a pill ... versus chemotherapy that means going to the hospital,\" Amgen oncology head Jean-Charles Soria told Reuters.Lumakras was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year under an accelerated pathway for advanced lung cancer patients with KRAS mutations whose disease has worsened after treatment with chemotherapy or other medicines. The agency also asked Amgen to study a lower dose of Lumakras, known chemically as sotorasib. The company said those results are expected in the fourth quarter of this year.The FDA is slated to make an approval decision on a potential rival KRAS-targeting drug, Mirati Therapeutics (NASDAQ:MRTX) Inc's adagrasib, by mid-December.Mirati in May said adagrasib shrank tumors in 44% of advanced lung cancer patients in clinical trials, but also caused serious side effects in 43% of them.At the ESMO meeting this week, Amgen is also presenting early data from a trial of Lumakras in combination with other cancer drugs for patients with colorectal cancer.  \n",

            "U.S.railroadunionswarnofcargodelaysascontractdeadlineloomsBy Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two unions negotiating contracts for almost 60,000 workers at major U.S. freight railways on Sunday said those employers are halting shipments of some cargo to gain leverage ahead of this week's deadline to secure labor agreements. Unions and railroads, including  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa)'s BNSF, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), and  Norfolk Southern  (NYSE:NSC), have until a minute after midnight on Friday to reach tentative deals. Failing to do so opens the door to union strikes, employer lockouts, and congressional intervention. Railroads late last week said they would begin halting shipments of hazardous and toxic materials starting on Monday to ensure safety in the event of a strike. \"They are locking out their customers ... and further harming the supply chain in an effort to provoke congressional action,\" Jeremy Ferguson, president of the transportation division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (SMART-TD), and Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), said in a joint statement on Sunday.The brinkmanship comes at a sensitive time for unions, railroads, shippers, consumers, and President Joe Biden - who appointed an emergency board to help break the impasse. Widespread railroad disruptions could choke supplies of food and fuel, spawn transportation chaos, stoke inflation, and cause $2 billion per day in lost economic output. As of Sunday, 8 of 12 unions had reached tentative deals, the National Railway Labor Conference (NRLC) said. Those groups do not include SMART-TD and BLET, which represent about half of the 115,000 workers affected by the talks. \"Railroads do not believe a national service interruption is inevitable but the time has arrived when certain customers will begin to be impacted if agreements are not reached,\" the Association of American Railroads (AAR (NYSE:AIR)) said of the industry's decision to pause hazardous shipments.  \n",

            "UbisoftCEOsaysstillopentootherpartnersafterTencentdeal(This Sept. 10 story corrects annual revenue target from three pillar video games to 2 billion euros in paragraph 15)By Mathieu RosemainPARIS (Reuters) - Ubisoft, France's biggest video games maker, is still open to other partners after a deal in which China's Tencent will raise its stake in the company, its co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot said on Thursday.Guillemot's comments, made at a closed press event whose content the company asked not to be made public before a showcase event online on Saturday, came on the heels of a rough day for Ubisoft's stock, which tumbled 17% after the group announced Tencent would become its single biggest shareholder with an overall stake of 11%.The deal values the \"Assassin's Creed\" maker at about $10 billion.\"We remain totally independent and we can act with any outside company if we want to,\" said Guillemot, who along his four brothers founded Ubisoft in 1986. \"That was a big negotiation with Tencent,\" he added. \"We can do whatever we want.\" Traders and analysts have said the Tencent deal, which sees the world's largest games firm by revenue enter into a shareholder pact with the Guillemots, removed the speculative appeal of Ubisoft shares. The group has long been seen as a takeover target as the Guillemots hold a minority stake in the group. Still, the Guillemot brothers managed to fend off a raid by French tycoon Vincent Bollore via his media group Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY). Smaller mobile video game maker Gameloft, formerly led by Yves Guillemot's brother Michel, was gobbled up by Vivendi six years ago. The secretive siblings, sons of agricultural traders from a small town in Brittany, western France, have vowed to protect their independence, a goal which Yves Guillemot, 62, reasserted on Thursday. \"Our first intention is to own our destiny,\" he said.MEANINGFUL PROGRESS That prospect was tested recently by a combination of weak financial results and allegations of sexual harassment, that led to a revamp of the company's governance and pledges to change a corporate culture described as sexist by some former employees. \"Yes, we stumbled, and we acknowledge that\", Guillemot said. \"We learned a lot along the way and have made meaningful progress with concrete action plans collectively led by our leaders.\"Ubisoft burnt through about 200 million euros in cash operationally during its 2020/2021 financial year, having generated 169 million of operational cash flow the year before. The company's financial woes came on top of several delays in the release of new video games and heightened pressure on management, in the midst of a boom and M&A wave in the video game industry. These were notably marked by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s plan to acquire \"Call of Duty\" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $69 billion. As part of its plan to return to growth, Ubisoft is aiming to deploy its three \"pillar\" games - \"Assassin's Creed\", \"Far Cry\" and \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six\" - on all digital platforms, Guillemot said. The group aims for these three brands to reach a total of 2 billion euros in annual revenue within five years, Guillemot said.Guillemot said \"Assassin's Creed\" will release its next edition \"Mirage\" in 2023. Ubisoft is also partnering with streaming platform Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to develop three original mobile games, including one based on Assassin's Creed.  \n",

            "EBRDtohelpfundtransitionfromgastowindpowerinEgyptBy Aidan LewisCAIRO (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will help finance the decommissioning of 5GW of inefficient gas-fired power plants in Egypt from 2023 while pledging up to $1 billion for renewables, its regional director said on Sunday. EBRD would raise up to $300 million in sovereign financing for projects including work to stabilise Egypt's grid, adding battery storage, developing the local supply chain for renewables, and retraining workers, said Heike Harmgart, EBRD's managing director for the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean.A separate $1 billion pledged for renewables would be about one tenth of the private funding needed for 10GW of mainly wind-powered projects planned by the government by 2028, she added. Egypt is a natural gas producer that is trying to cut down on domestic consumption so that it can export more to Europe at a time of high prices and demand resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.It has a power surplus after installing three huge gas-fired power plants built by Siemens from 2015. The government is hoping gas exports can help contain pressure on Egypt's currency after the Ukraine war triggered the latest dip in dollar inflows from portfolio investment and tourism.The role of gas is set to be an issue of dispute at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt in November. Climate activists say there should a rapid transition away from gas. As host of COP27, Egypt is giving a voice to some African states that want to continue using gas as a transition fuel to develop their economies. About 3GW of the planned 10GW of new renewable power would be made available for a pilot phase in the production of green hydrogen in Egypt's Red Sea port of Ain Sokhna, Harmgart said.Some would go to replacing capacity lost through the decommissioning of the thermal power plants. Egypt has announced a string of memoranda of understanding for green hydrogen and ammonia projects at Ain Sokhna.  \n",

Failure to reach a settlement before a cooling-off period expires on Sept. 16 could open the door to strikes, employer lockouts and congressional intervention.Talks are \"active and ongoing\" a spokesperson for the Association of American Railroads said on Friday. Union Pacific did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours. Last month, President Joe Biden appointed a presidential emergency board that made settlement recommendations to help avoid disruptions to food and fuel supplies and worsening inflation. BNSF said the remaining unions and other railroads continue to work to reach voluntary agreements based on the board's recommendations to avoid interruption to rail service. The largest U.S. trucking industry group on Friday urged Congress to be prepared to prevent railroad shutdowns if the negotiations fail to produce contracts by the deadline. \"Congress should take swift action ... to avoid a debilitating and unnecessary labor disruption that could cost the country billions each day,\" Chris Spear, chief executive of the American Trucking Associations (ATA), wrote in a letter to congressional leadership.In the early 1990s, Congress required the two sides to engage in final and binding arbitration to prevent disruptions to shipping activities.Unions and freight railroads have so far reached tentative agreements covering 21,000 workers represented by five of the 12 unions involved in the negotiations. A railroad work stoppage would cost the U.S. economy $2 billion per day in output and require 467,000 long-haul trucks daily to handle shipments diverted from rail - exceeding supply, the railroad association said.\"Additional insecurity placed on the still fragile U.S. supply chain – as we recover from COVID and other supply chain stressors and move towards the holiday season - will harm the economy at large and individual Americans,\" ATA's Spear said.  \n",

The company has registered almost 65,000 reservations globally, and it expects to sell 750,000 EVs per year by 2026, starting with the VF8 and VF9 all-electric SUVs.In March, VinFast said it would build a production plant in North Carolina with an initial projected capacity of 150,000 EVs a year.

The onerous crew quarantine rules had made rostering difficult and were a major impediment to the airline returning to more normal operations.Cathay's passenger capacity was at just 12.4% of pre-pandemic levels in the month of July, although its cargo capacity was at 51% in part because cargo crews were no longer required to quarantine.Before the passenger crew rules were lifted, Cathay forecast it would reach 25% of pre-pandemic capacity by the end of the year.Cathay said it would continue to add back flights as quickly as feasible, but it would take time to rebuild capacity as it involves a substantial amount of crew training and reactivating stored aircraft.\"This, combined with other operational complexities, means that capacity can only be increased gradually over a period of several months,\" the airline said in a statement on Saturday that did not provide updated capacity guidance.Cathay has said it plans to hire an additional 4,000 staff to fill operational needs over the next 18 to 24 months as travel rebounds, having cut more than 6,000 jobs during the pandemic.Pilot attrition has been higher than normal because of the onerous quarantine requirements, combined with permanent pay cuts of as much as 58%.The Hong Kong government said on Friday that crew members would still need to remain isolated in their hotel rooms when on layovers outside the city.  \n",

An announcement is expected over the next weeks.Yara declined to comment on \"market rumors.\" Petrobras declined to comment on the choosing of Yara's proposal, referring to its latest filing in late August in which it said the companies could present binding proposals.In a statement later on Friday, Petrobras denied imminence of a sale, adding the process is in the binding phase, \"having not reached the stage of receiving proposals.\"Yara already owns five plants in Brazil and 24 mixing facilities. It also owns mining and port operations. Petrobras' fertilizer unit, known as UFN-III, is based in Mato Grosso do Sul state, one of Brazil's largest grain producers.The sources did not specify the deal value, but said it will be lower than $100 million, since the unit is not yet operational.Petrobras has been trying to sell the unit for some time. In February it agreed to sell it to Russian group Acron, but the deal collapsed. In May, the oil company relaunched the process with advisory of the investment banking unit of Banco Bradesco SA. Other companies interested in the deal included Brazilian group Unigel and steelmaker CSN. The final deal announcement has been delayed due to recent changes in Petrobras' board. Brazil is highly dependent on fertilizer imports. Construction of the fertilizer unit in the city of Tres Lagoas began in 2011 and was stopped in 2014 with 81% completed after Petrobras rescinded a contract alleging companies were not compliant.When operational, the unit is expected to produce 2,200 tonnes of ammonia and 3,600 tonnes of urea daily, around 20% of the urea consumption in the country. The unit is expected to be completed within two to three years. Petrobras is expected to offer the acquirer an option of buying the unit with a natural gas supply contract. The state-controlled company had a larger fertilizer business, but began divesting in 2018. Interest for fertilizer businesses has risen after the Ukraine war interrupted supply and raised fertilizer prices. \n",

Apple and the IFT were not immediately available for comment. A wave of lawsuits and complaints challenging the pair's app store rules in various countries over recent years has led Google to lower fees and Apple to loosen rules, but some app developers and other critics say more changes are needed.De Swaan Addati added that Mexico's competition regulator had declined his request to open an investigation into the companies, prompting him to take his case to the IFT.\"I have full confidence that (the IFT) will investigate and exercise its powers - in line with international best practices - so that these companies stop abusing their market power to the detriment of developers and consumers,\" he said.According to data firm Statista, over 30 million smartphones were forecast to be sold in Mexico last year.Google's Android has the largest market share in Mexico with 77% penetration, according to the latest data from Statcounter.Apple is facing scrutiny elsewhere in the region, with Brazilian regulators having banned the sale of iPhones without a charger earlier this week..  \n",

            "TropicalstormthreatenstofanCaliforniawildfires,butwillcooloffstateSACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) -A tropical storm approaching Southern California on Friday threatened to bring high winds that could whip up wildfires and heavy rainfall that could trigger flash floods, but the system will also bring relief from a brutal, 10-day heat wave. Tropical Storm Kay was expected to generate wind gusts of up to 100 miles per hour, potentially fanning the flames of the Fairview Fire, which has already scorched about 27,000 acres (10,926 hectares) in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles. The fire, which was 5% contained, has already forced more than 35,000 evacuations. \"We could go from a fire suppression event into significant rain, water rescues, mudslides, debris flows. We have challenging days ahead,\" said Deputy Chief Jeff Veik of Cal Fire’s Riverside Unit on Thursday during a community meeting. Rain began in the area Friday afternoon, helping firefighters battle the blaze, said Cal Fire spokesman Rob Roseen. By late afternoon, winds were still slow.The storm, which weakened from hurricane force overnight, was threatening Baja California, other parts of Mexico and the U.S. Southwest with heavy rains that could cause dangerous flash flooding, landslides and mudslides, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. Parts of Baja California could see more than 10 inches (25 cm) while spots in Southern California could get 6 to 8 inches of rain from heavy downpours as Kay pushes inland on Friday and into the weekend, the service said. \"Extended periods of moderate to heavy rain will be capable of producing rural and urban flooding,\" the service said. \"Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take action.\"Strong easterly winds of 40 to 50 mph with gusts up to 100 mph were also in the forecast for Southern California, the NWS said, warning that gusts could down trees and power lines and make travel difficult.COOLER TEMPERATURES The storm will also give California much-needed relief from the scorching heat wave it has endured over the last 10 days, NWS meteorologist Bill South said.It \"will move over us tomorrow and provide us with some cloud cover and maybe some light rain and much cooler temperatures,\" he said. Still, temperatures on Friday reached 101 degrees Fahrenheit at Los Angeles International Airport, breaking a record of 96 degrees Fahrenheit set in 1984, the National Weather Service said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). In the state capital of Sacramento, temperatures were expected to reach 106 degrees Fahrenheit. The region has suffered from temperatures well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit all week.The forecast of cooler temperatures follows a string of days when conservation efforts helped the power grid avoid rotating outages, according to the California Independent System Operator (ISO), grid operator for most of the state.ISO Chief Executive Elliot Mainzer said that while the lower temperatures were decreasing, overall demand for electricity, cloud cover and smoke would reduce the state's critical supplies of solar energy by as much as 60% compared to earlier in the week. \"Our colleagues down in Southern California today really have their work cut out for them as we go from one extreme weather condition to the next,\" Mainzer said, noting utilities could also face challenges keeping the lights on if heavy rain and winds prompt floods or mudslides. By mid-afternoon, however, his agency's website showed that demand for energy was not outstripping supply.Edison International (NYSE:EIX)'s Southern California Edison utility, which serves five million customers in the southern third of California, was considering shutting off power to about 53,000 customers on Friday in order to lessen the risk of power lines igniting wildfires. \"The utility's concern is the short window of time before the rains start. We don't want any of the utility's equipment to cause wildfires during that time,\" said company spokesman David Song. The grid came close to imposing rotating outages on Tuesday, when power demand hit an all-time high and electric prices spiked to two-year highs.The ISO wants consumers to conserve energy during the late afternoon hours when the sun begins to go down and less solar power is generated. Renewable energy including solar power has provided about a third of the grid's electricity during the middle of the day, but far less once evening falls. \n",

Prosecutors there have said they would recommend the sentence run concurrent with the Manhattan sentence. Sadleir's lawyers had urged Engelmayer not to impose a prison term, saying the father of two young boys was \"deeply sorry for, and embarrassed by, his crimes,\" and that there was \"no chance\" of recidivism.\"Mr. Sadleir is obviously disappointed with today's sentence, but accepts the court's judgment,\" his lawyer Matthew Schwartz said in an email. Sadleir also apologized to his family and Aviron employees, Schwartz added.Aviron's films had included Berry's \"Kidnap\" and McConaughey and Anne Hathaway's \"Serenity.\" \n",

It is expected to show that prices rose at an 8.1% pace over the year in August, compared with 8.5% in July. Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) economists expect headline inflation to log its steepest monthly decline since the peak of the pandemic in April 2020, helped by a pullback in gas prices.All 11 major S&P sectors traded higher on Friday, with communication services, technology, energy and consumer discretionary leading the way.Hammered since the beginning of the year over concerns about higher interest rates, high-growth stocks rose in the week.Investors are jittery about the prospects of another outsized interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. On Friday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the Fed should be aggressive with rate hikes while the economy \"can take a punch,\" while Kansas City Fed President Esther George said taming inflation could be a tough task.Both remarks come after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that the U.S. central bank is \"strongly committed\" to controlling inflation.Traders are pricing in a 90% chance of a 75 basis point rate hike at the next meeting, up from 57% a week earlier, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fedwatch Tool https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html.The CBOE volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, closed to a two-week low of 22.79 but stayed above its long-term average of about 20.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 377.19 points, or 1.19%, to 32,151.71, the S&P 500 gained 61.18 points, or 1.53%, to 4,067.36 and the Nasdaq Composite added 250.18 points, or 2.11%, to 12,112.31.For the week, the Dow advanced 2.7%, the S&P 500 climbed 3.6% and the Nasdaq gained 4.1%.

            "GlobalstandardsbodyapprovesnewmerchantcodeforgunsellersBy Ross Kerber(Reuters) -An international standards body has approved creation of a merchant code for gun retailers, a representative said on Friday, following pressure from activists who say it will help track suspicious weapons purchases.At a meeting this week, a subcommittee of the International Organization for Standardization approved what is known as a \"merchant category code\" for firearms stores, a spokeswoman said.The decision by the Geneva-based nonprofit was long sought https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senator-warren-and-representative-dean-urge-bank-ceos-to-adopt-new-code-for-gun-and-ammunition-retailers by advocates of tighter gun regulation, such as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats including New York City Mayor Eric Adams. It clears the way for banks that process gun retailers' payments to decide whether to assign the new code to merchants. The code would help monitors track where an individual spends money, but would not show what specific items were purchased.The codes were requested of the Swiss body known as ISO by  Amalgamated Bank  (NASDAQ:AMAL) of New York, which calls itself a socially responsible lender and investor. In a statement, Amalgamated Chief Executive Priscilla Sims Brown said the codes will allow financial institutions to use new tools to detect and report suspicious activity associated with gun trafficking and mass shootings, without impeding legal gun sales.\"This action answers the call of millions of Americans who want safety from gun violence,\" Brown said.Some gun-rights activists had worried the new codes could lead to unauthorized surveillance. Mass shootings this year including at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 children and two teachers have added to the long-running U.S. debate over gun control.Several top U.S. pension funds had submitted shareholder resolutions asking payments companies to weigh in on the issue. After the ISO decision was first reported by Reuters on Friday, a number of gun-control activists and politicians called for payment companies to adopt the new codes. Several cited news accounts https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/24/business/dealbook/mass-shootings-credit-cards.html of how mass shooters had bought high-powered guns on credit.New York State Attorney General Letitia James wrote https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1568338548100587521 on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that \"credit card companies must now take the next step and flag suspicious transactions on gun and ammunition sales like they do for fraud and money laundering.\"A representative for Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) said that following ISO's approval, \"We now turn our focus to how it will be implemented by merchants and their banks as we continue to support lawful purchases on our network while protecting the privacy and decisions of individual cardholders.\" American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), in a statement sent by a representative, said when ISO develops a new code the company works with third-party processors and partners on implementation.\"We are focused on ensuring that we have the right controls in place to meet our regulatory and fiduciary responsibilities, as well as prevent illegal activity on our network,\" the company said.

Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets have soared in popularity over recent years and are getting increasingly intertwined with the regulated financial system, saddling policymakers with monitoring risks in a largely unregulated sector. 2022 has seen a sharp drop in crypto demand though, as global risk sentiment was walloped by the Ukraine crisis, aggressive monetary policy tightening and decades-high inflation.

            "BanksseestrongdemandforCitrixdebtafterdiscount-sourcesBy Matt Tracy and Abigail Summerville(Reuters) - Banks seeking to sell some of the debt backing the $16.5 billion leveraged buyout of business software company Citrix Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CTXS) to investors have received more demand than they can fill, raising the prospect they may suffer a smaller loss than expected, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Banks led by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse Group AG and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) agreed in January to provide $15 billion in junk-rated debt to investment firms Vista Equity Partners and Elliott Investment Management LP for the acquisition of Citrix.As with all such deals, the banks syndicate the debt to investors to get it off their books and recycle their capital. But the market turned following the signing of the deal, as rampant inflation led central banks to jack up interest rates.This made the Citrix debt look too cheap in the eyes of investors, forcing banks to discount it in the syndication. The deal has become a key test for banks that are asked to finance big leveraged buyouts. Many are waiting for the outcome of the Citrix syndication before making new debt commitments.The banks are currently syndicating only a slice of the $15 billion Citrix debt package as they gauge investor demand. They are marketing a $4.05 billion term loan with an annual interest rate of 450 basis points over the SOFR benchmark, the sources said. Their books taking orders for that loan have been oversubscribed, the sources added.The banks discounted the loan to 92 cents on the dollar, which would lead to a collective loss for them of hundreds of millions of dollars, the sources added. But the strong demand for it, likely fueled by investor optimism that the junk debt market is stabilizing, may result in the banks offloading the debt at a smaller discount or selling more than they originally planned so they have less of it to sell down the line, according to the sources. It is also possible that the banks proceed to sell the debt as originally marketed to the investors, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Investors have until Sept. 19 to commit to the Citrix loan.The banks still have more Citrix debt sitting on their books they are looking to offload to investors. This includes a $500 million-equivalent euro loan, as well as a $3.5 billion bank tranche and a $3.95 billion second-lien term loan. The banks also plan to sell some $3 billion in Citrix bonds to investors next week.Most banks have been holding leveraged buyout debt on their books until the market improves. Only a handful of loans were syndicated this year at a significant discount. This includes drugmaker Covis Pharma's $595 million term loan that was sold in February at 90 cents on the dollar.The junk debt market jitters have weighed on the ability of private equity firms to clinch new acquisitions. One example has been NCR (NYSE:NCR) Corp, a manufacturer of cash registers and automated teller machines with a $4.3 billion market capitalization that buyout firm Veritas Capital has struggled to negotiate a deal with, partly because of the difficulty of securing enough debt for an acquisition, according to people familiar with the matter.  \n",

            "Top5ThingstoWatchinMarketsintheWeekAheadBy Daniel ShvartsmanInvesting.com - Markets started September on a strong note, with the S&P 500 closing up 3.4% in the first full week of the month and the NASDAQ Composite jumping 4.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed only 2.4%. Whether that was just a market positioning adjustment or the sign of anything more sustained will be on watch this week, especially as a new set of inflation reports comes out. Corporate news is on the lighter side, though some big earnings reports and a rare major IPO are on the docket for the week ahead. This weekend served as a reminder of the ongoing and changing nature of the Russia-Ukraine war, and while the recent developments may not have a direct market impact, the repercussions could certainly reverberate through the financial world.Here's what you need to know for the week ahead in financial markets:A bevy of consumer price index (CPI) reports for August come out this week. India releases its CPI report on Monday, Germany, Spain, and the U.S. all release on Tuesday, the U.K. releases its report on Wednesday, France releases its report on Thursday, and Italy and the Eurozone as a whole release theirs on Friday.Producer Price Index (PPI) reports are also due out from Japan, Switzerland (Tuesday), the U.K. (Wednesday), and the U.S. The expectations are for inflation to be easing in the U.S., with month over month Core CPI expected at 0.3%, matching last month’s number; this would mark the lowest back-to-back readings since last fall. Headline CPI is expected to be -0.1%, as dropping gas prices continue to take pressure off inflation. Core PPI is expected to be 0.3%, a rise from last month’s 0.2%, while the headline PPI number is also expected to be -0.1%.Those expectations are quite different in Europe; the U.K. is forecast to see core CPI month over month growth of 0.8%, a significant jump, while headline CPI is expected to jump another 0.6%. The Eurozone is forecast to see a 0.5% rise in the core CPI number, a jump from last month’s revised figure of 0.1%. The same is expected of headline CPI, as energy prices still loom large with the seasons changing.The ECB has already made its latest move, hiking interest rates by 75 basis points last week. The Fed is expected to stick to at least a 50 basis points hike if not 75, and the inflation reports are not expected to shake it, but no doubt Chair Jerome Powell would welcome signs that inflation is at least moderating meaningfully.The Bank of England, whose meeting was due this week but postponed in the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, faces a more fluctuating environment with new Prime Minister Liz Truss in charge and already having issued a major energy plan. Its effect on the market is among the things the BOE will have to weigh; it will also get an employment report as an additional piece of data to throw into the mix.While Q2 earnings season has just about played itself out, there are two key software companies reporting results that are worth watching.Software giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) reports Monday after the close, and is expected to show 4% earnings growth in its first quarter including newest acquisition Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN). Oracle received a recent price target upgrade from a Global Equities analyst in light of the Cerner deal, as well as a buy rating from Guggenheim, but like many in the software and tech industry, has been adjusting to a more difficult macro environment, as the company has been reported to have started lay-offs. So the earnings report and conference call may be revealing.Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reports Thursday after the market close. The company is expected to post 7.3% earnings growth and 12.6% revenue growth. A Jefferies analyst warned that the company hasn’t adjusted guidance for macro headwinds, only forex effects, so there could be more room to disappoint. The company disappointed in its prior report but the share price has since more than recovered. Adobe’s role as one of the original software companies that transitioned successfully to a SaaS (software as a service) model makes its report a useful bellwether.2022’s volatile trading has left the IPO market as a casualty, with most IPOs that have made it to market being of the thinly traded, relatively obscure type. Corebridge Financial is a spin-off from AIG (NYSE:AIG) but will come to market via an IPO rather than a direct issuing to AIG shareholders. It focuses on retirement solutions and insurance plans. The company is due to start trading on Thursday, and seeks to raise $1.68-$1.92B before factoring in fees or underwriter share purchases, vs. a valuation range of $13.6-$15.6B.Read more about the IPO here: 7 Things to Know About the Corebridge Financial IPOWith the summer over and earnings season in its quietest moments, many companies are hitting the road to meet with investors.

Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions in the south of the country, near Kherson, and should they be able to maintain an attack on two fronts and take and hold territory, it would mark a different tone.Russia has continued to escalate economic pressure on Europe with the shutting down of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. While the military landscape is shifting and uncertain, it is not hard to imagine that Russian setbacks could only increase Russia’s willingness to use its economic leverage with Ukraine and with Ukraine’s supporters in predictable and unpredictable ways, which could put more pressure on European countries to resolve their energy situation before the winter arrives, and which makes the inflation reports mentioned at the top of the article all the more relevant. \n",

            "Energy&PreciousMetals-WeeklyReviewandOutlookBy Barani KrishnanInvesting.com - Let’s take a moment to say a prayer in memory of all of those who gave their lives on this fateful day 21 years ago. To the victims of 9/11, you live on in our hearts.Thank you. Now, back to the business of energy and precious metals and the week that was. For those surprised with how much gasoline prices had fallen at the pump since the height of summer demand — from a record $5.01 a gallon in mid-June to below $3.50 in several spots in the U.S. East Coast this weekend — here’s some news: Those prices could fall further.John Treanor, a spokesman at the American Automobile Association, told Salt Lake City, Utah-based station KSL-TV that the price at the pump is expected to drop even more as we head into colder months. Treanor said customers could see a decrease of 7 to 10 cents per gallon when gas switches from a summer blend to a winter blend.\"In the winter months, what's called the Reid Vapor Pressure — it's a gauge that the EPA uses to regulate how much emissions your fuel can have — changes. In the winter months that range can be higher,\" Treanor said. The EPA refers to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is tasked with environmental protection matters.While the forthcoming fuel blend switch at the pump may be even friendlier to consumers’ wallets, the drawback might be a slight hit to the environment — in terms of air quality, that is. EPA regulations passed in 1990 allow more butane in gas during winter months and that makes the gas less expensive.\"That means you can put more butane in,” said Treanor, explaining. “Butane is essentially a filler there. It helps your fuel burn a little faster, burn a little hotter, but it does cause more vapor.”Treanor’s remarks come after comments by Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, who told TheStreet a few weeks ago that prices in a few states could even drop below $3 soon. The states most likely to benefit from such a steep dip would be Texas, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Kentucky.Such a circumstance would put prices lower than this time last year, when the national average was $3.18 for regular unleaded, based on AAA figures.Pump prices are primarily determined by the price of crude oil, which varies based on supply, consumer demand and other factors. Taxes also play into prices, and many states have enacted “gas tax holidays” this summer to help consumers fill their tanks.Leaving taxes aside, let’s look at the price of crude first. From its March 7 peak of $139.13 a barrel two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine and the start of Western sanctions on Russia that caused the global upheaval of commodities, Brent hit a seven-month low of $87.25 in the just-ended week. While it ended the week higher at $92.84 a barrel, it was still down some $46, or 33%, from its March peak.U.S. crude’s West Texas Intermediate benchmark, hit a seven-month low of $81.20 per barrel but settled the week at $86.79. That was still down almost $44, or 34%, from its March 7 peak of $130.50.Demand-wise, U.S. crude stockpile numbers have been quite volatile in recent months, though leaning bearish of late.Crude oil inventories rose by 8.844 million last week, the highest for a week since the week ended April 8, when there was a build of 9.382 million. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a crude drawdown of 250,000 barrels instead for last week. The crude build indicated weakening demand for fuels with the winding down of the peak summer travel period.Inventories of gasoline, America’s top automobile fuel, climbed by a modest 333,000 barrels against expectations for a draw of 1.667 million barrels.Stocks of distillates — the oil variant required for making the diesel needed for trucks, buses and trains, as well as the fuel for jets — rose by 95,000 barrels, less than the rise of 530,000 that had been expected. Exports of U.S. crude, another important component of the weekly data, slowed to 3.433 million barrels per day (bpd) last week from the prior week’s 3.967 million bpd.But analysts — especially oil bulls — contend that statistics on crude have been messed up by the release of tens of million barrels from the U.S. emergency stockpile, or Strategic Petroleum Reserve, known as the SPR. The SPR again saw a large outflow of 7.5 million barrels last week that brought the stockpile there to 442.5 million — its lowest since November 1984. The Biden administration has been drawing down the SPR since November 2021 to make up the shortfall in crude supply on the domestic market for fuels. But outflows from the reserve really accelerated in May when the administration embarked on a battle to bring down the spiraling pump price of gasoline that had bumped US inflation to 40-year highs. The president has committed to draw down 180 million barrels from the reserve over a six-month period — or roughly one million barrels per day — between May and October.  At latest count, the SPR had released a total of 173.8 million barrels since March, a figure that includes volumes associated with an earlier round of tenders, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.Which brings us to the question of what happens after October. Those long oil are betting the house that post-October, when excess crude hanging over the market clears, the WTI price for a barrel would shoot back to above $100 — with Brent fetching about $10 more than whatever the U.S. benchmark does.This week, it appeared initially that the Biden administration might hamper those bets when Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Reuters in an interview that the SPR drawdowns might be extended beyond October. But White House officials, speaking anonymously, told CNN later that there were no plans as of now to continue with SPR withdrawals after October.Besides the end of SPR drawdowns, oil bulls might benefit from the increasingly bellicose position of Russian President Vladimir Putin towards the West for its ever-tightening sanctions against his country. Furious with the latest G7-endorsed cap on the selling price of Russian oil, Putin is eager to hit back and hurt the U.S. and its allies in the most painful way possible. His plan, which almost everyone other than probably his gardener knew from day one, is to shut all oil and gas supplies to the world. Such action would presumably send oil prices spiraling back to high $100s. But some analysts say the global economy, especially Europe’s, is almost certain to go into an unmitigated recession in such a case, and that could bring energy prices back down. Also, some meteorologists are cautioning that a warmer-than-usual start to the 2022/23 winter could result in more surprises for oil bulls.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced that there was a 91% chance that La Niña conditions would stay in place through November with a 53% chance of La Niña continuing through March 2023. During the winter, La Niña events typically bring warmer and drier weather to North Texas. Warmer than normal waters in the Gulf of Mexico can help increase the warmth of the air and moisture content, fueling strong storms.There’s just no easy way out for either side on this.U.S. crude’s WTI did a final trade of $86.10, after settling Friday’s official session up $3.35, or 3.9%, at $86.79 per barrel. For the week, WTI was off by just 8 cents or less than 0.1%. Prior to the rebound, it hit a seven-month low of $81.20 this week, pulverized by new Covid-19 lockdowns in top oil importer China.London-traded Brent, which serves as the global benchmark for oil, did a final trade of $92.42 after settling the official session up $3.69, or 4.1%, at $92.84.  For the week, it was off by 18 cents or 0.2%. Prior to the rebound, Brent hit a seven-month low of $87.25 this week.WTI continues to remain bearish for the fourth month in a row and for more than ten weeks, with WTI settling below the weekly middle Bollinger Band, noted SKCharting.com’s chief technical strategist Sunil Kumar Dixit.Weekly stochastics have been struggling to rebel out of long oversold territories, Dixit said, although he added that this week’s drop to $81.20 witnessed some resilience as prices rebounded from the monthly middle Bollinger Band of $82.50.“A short-term rebound towards the daily middle Bollinger Band of $89.40 is a high probability,” Dixit said.“If WTI makes a sustained break above a swing high of $90.40, we expect a further upside towards the 50 Week EMA of $92.35 and the 50 Day EMA of $93.90 followed by the 200 Day SMA $96.40,” he said, referring to the Exponential Moving Average and Simple Moving Average, respectively.But he said the risk of a further drop wasn’t over yet, either. “On the downside, weakness below $82.50 will call for a drop to the 100-Week SMA of $76.70,” Dixit said. “However, bears may prefer to wait for better positioning, when prices approach the 200-Day SMA of $96.40, before pulling the trigger.”Gold had its first weekly gain in four as the dollar retreated further on Friday from its biggest rally in two decades, allowing bullion to somewhat reinforce its standing as a safe haven.The benchmark gold futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,727.60 per ounce, after settling Friday’s official session up $8.40, or 0.8%, at $1,728.60. For the week, it gained 0.3% after a cumulative 5.2% loss over three previous weeks.The Dollar Index, which pits itself against six major currencies led by the euro, slid for the third day in a row, reaching a low of 108.35 from Wednesday’s 20-year high of 110.79. The greenback slid even as Federal Reserve officials pushed on Friday for another outsized rate hike to keep inflation down, when the central bank meets on Sept. 21.The spot price of bullion, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, was last traded at $1,717.62, up $9.03, or 0.5%.“Gold is higher as the historic run higher in the dollar appears to have run out of steam,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.  “It seems Wall Street is getting comfortable with the idea of another 75-basis point rate hike by the Fed.”SKCharting’s Dixit, who tracks spot gold instead of futures, said the risk of a further drop to the 200-Week SMA of $1,675 and the 50-Month EMA of $1,672 remain on the cards.“Gold's rebound attempts from $1,688 has witnessed a cautious approach from buyers as prices tested $1,730,” Dixit said. “Gold needs to break above or below the $1746-$1688 range of the previous week.”He referred to Tuesday’s scheduled release of the August Consumer Price Index as one that may have a major say in gold’s price move for the coming week. “In the short term, a sustained move above $1,712 indicates buying towards $1,728 and the 5-Day EMA of $1,732. A sustained break below $1,712 indicates sellers are pushing gold towards $1,705 and $1,700, below which $1,690 can be tested.”“Gold actually needs to clear the $1,750-$1,760 zone in order to reclaim the $1,800-$1,808 swing top.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.\n",
            "OilEdgesLowerasDemandConcerns,RussiaPriceCapsTakeFocusBy Ambar Warrick Investing.com-- Oil prices edged lower on Monday after a volatile week, as traders gauged concerns over slowing demand and U.S.-led price caps on Russian crude exports. London-traded Brent oil futures fell 0.3% to $92.14 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 0.9% to $86.05 a barrel by 20:18 ET (00:18 GMT). Both contracts settled slightly lower after a volatile run last week, as a minimal supply cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies did little to offset fears of slowing demand in China.Trade data showed that Chinese oil imports slowed substantially in August due to COVID-related disruptions in the economy. This week, markets await more details on Washington’s planned price caps on Russian oil exports, which are expected to be imposed in December. Moscow has vowed to ramp up crude exports to Asia in response to the move- a trend that could potentially bring crude prices lower next year. Oil prices plummeted from highs hit in the initial days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict this year as concerns over slowing global economic activity largely outweighed supply disruptions caused by the conflict.But this trend may reverse in the winter, especially as the European Union winds down Russian oil imports. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Americans could face higher gasoline prices in the winter, and that the proposed price caps on Russian oil are intended to offset such a scenario. The U.S. is steadily drawing on its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to stabilize local gasoline prices, which surged to record highs earlier this year. This has seen the SPR fall to a 40-year low, with traders forecasting large gains in oil prices if the SPR draw is halted. Gasoline demand in the U.S. has also remained steady. Focus this week is also on upcoming U.S. CPI inflation data, due on Tuesday. The reading is likely to factor into the Federal Reserve’s plans to hike interest rates, which will be priced into crude markets.Strength in the dollar has weighed on crude prices this year, given that it makes importing oil more expensive. Major importers India and Indonesia in particular have felt the heat from a stronger greenback.  \n",
            "Asiastocksedgeup,dollarrestrainedbeforeCPIBy Wayne ColeSYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian share markets made cautious gains on Monday on hopes a key reading on U.S. inflation will show some cooling, while the U.S. dollar was restrained by the risk of higher European interest rates and Japanese intervention.Holidays in China and South Korea made for slow trading, while traders were unsure about what implications Ukraine's surprising success against Russian forces might have.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2%, having bounced modestly from a two-year low hit last week. Japan's Nikkei added another 0.9%, after rallying 2% last week.Wall Street looked to extend Friday's bounce and S&P 500 futures edged up 0.1%, while Nasdaq futures gained 0.2%.Bulls are hoping Tuesday's reading on U.S. consumer prices will hint at a peak for inflation as falling petrol prices are seen pulling down the headline index by 0.1%. The core is forecast to rise 0.3%, though some analysts see a chance of a softer report.\"Arguably, with the economy having contracted through the first half, and household discretionary spending capacity under significant pressure, we are due a modest downside surprise,\" said economists at Westpac.\"As such, we forecast +0.2% for core and -0.2% for headline,\" they added. \"If achieved though, it should not be assumed that October and beyond will see repeats, with volatility likely to persist.\"A soft number might revive speculation the Federal Reserve will only hike by 50 basis points this month, though it would likely have to be very weak to have a real impact given how stridently hawkish policy makers have been recently.The market currently implies an 88% chance the Fed will hike by 75 basis points.BofA global economist Ethan Harris fears that by focusing on actual inflation to determining when to stop, central banks may go too far. The bank has lifted its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 4.0-4.25%, with a 75bp hike in September and smaller rises thereafter.\"For investors, this means more pressure on interest rates, more weakness in risk assets and further upside for the super-strong dollar,\" said Harris.\"In our view, these trends only turn when markets price the full fury of central bank hikes and we are not quite there yet.\" DOLLAR NOT DONE YETFor now, the dollar has run into some profit taking from a market that is very long of the currency after a month of sustained gains. So rapidly has the dollar risen on the yen that Japanese authorities are becoming increasingly vocal in protesting their currency's decline, sparking speculation of intervention and putting pressure on the Bank of Japan to moderate its policy of yield curve control.Japan's government must take steps as needed to counter excessive declines in the yen, a senior government official said on Sunday, after it hit its weakest level against the dollar in 24 years. That was enough to see the dollar hold at 142.67 yen and off last week's top of 144.99. The dollar index stood at 108.820, having reached as high as 110.790 last week.The euro inched up to $1.0067, and away from its recent trough of $0.9865.It was helped in part by a Reuters report that European Central Bank policymakers see a growing risk that they will have to raise their key interest rate to 2% or more to curb record-high inflation despite a likely recession.Analysts at ANZ noted the dollar over the past month was up roughly 9% against the euro and the Chinese yuan, 12% against the British pound and 19% against the yen.\"The rampant USD is causing strain in developing countries, which are finding imports priced in USD more expensive,\" they said in a note.\"With Fed speakers using every opportunity to hammer home a hawkish message and quantitative tightening looming, the USD is not about to dramatically turn.\" The ascent of the dollar combined with high bond yields has been a drag for gold, which was hovering at $1,718 an ounce after hitting a low of $1,690 last week. [GOL/]Oil prices have also been trending lower amid concerns about a global economic slowdown, though cuts to supply did prompt a 4% bounce on Friday. [O/R]Early Monday, Brent was down 36 cents at $92.48, while U.S. crude eased 45 cents to $86.34 per barrel.  \n",

            "FAANG2.0:SayHelloToMATANA,AndDevelopmentsInApple’sNewFrontierWhat’s in a name? If you are interested in the tech sector, maybe the better question is: What’s in an acronym? Because it’s the acronym that spells out just who the cool kids are.You have to go back about nine years to when the now-well-known FAANG group of stocks became a thing. The acronym was the label for all the up-and-coming tech companies that were poised to change our lives: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.Almost a decade later, they are considered the most successful U.S. tech companies. They are all household names. And they can move the markets, affecting the overall stock indices.Taken collectively, they are what we can, without a doubt, refer to as a financial behemoth, accounting for about 15% of the S&P 500.But every decade or so, everything shifts.Enter MATANA. Think of it as FAANG 2.0.MATANA, according to Constellation Research principal analyst Ray Wang, better represents the new world order of tech stocks. He has plucked Meta  – or the old Facebook – and Netflix out of the top tier of heavy hitters. And in their stead has elevated Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia.Hence:MicrosoftAppleTeslaAlphabetNvidiaAmazonHere are his arguments in favor of this re-ordering of the tech world’s elite class and why the new acronym might hold greater sway for the decade ahead.Meta (NASDAQ:META) (Facebook): Meta needs to define its plan, Wang said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.“Facebook has got to do something besides ads. Once again, they’re taking a beating for it. So, is it going to be the glasses? Is it going to be the metaverse? We're not there yet and that’s really kind of what the challenge is.”Meta Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX): The biggest question facing the streaming service, according to Wang: How many subscribers can it get?And that is the fundamental problem with its one-trick-pony business model. Growth could be limited if it is uniquely tied to its subscription model.Said Wang:“Product placement should be where they are, plus the ability to do (intellectual property) licensing. Look at how Disney makes its money.”Netflix Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT): According to Wang, the company has found a way to straddle key segments – what it provides corporate and consumer clients.Wang’s take:“They’re positioned well for the metaverse. They’re positioned well for the cloud and, of course, they’ve got their gaming business.”Microsoft Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA): Its growth potential lies with the continuously expanding need for microchips, but also in how it can play a big role in the emerging fields that could very well define the future.Said Wang: “Nvidia is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and more than the data center or gaming. They’re sitting at the edge between (artificial intelligence), the metaverse, the future of computing and the way they do their partnerships. They’re set up in a way that’s going to be dominant for quite some time.”Nvidia Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): The promotion into the acronym could settle a long-standing debate, confirmation that Tesla is not just a car company.Tesla Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comBut it is a car company, and in the less than 20 years since it was founded in 2003, it has disrupted the automotive sector.In 2021, Tesla was ranked as the most valuable automotive brand in the world. That same year, it was deemed the fastest growing brand on the planet. Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021.The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP. Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock.Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months.The company is expected to host another product launch event next month, where it is expected to show off its newest iPads and computers, which could trigger some movement in the stock price again.But one thing the latest Apple event sparked was a reaction for a much lesser known company – Globalstar Inc (NYSE:GSAT). The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications.The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service.The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77.Globalstar Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comThe initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality.Apple’s plans for the satellite service came with a plan to spend $450 million to support the feature, with Reuters reporting that a “majority” of that money is being funneled to Globalstar. This – on the surface – seemed like a big deal, given that Globalstar posted revenues last year that were less than a third of that amount. But the reality is that Globalstar will have to invest heavily in additional satellites to fulfill its deal to support the Apple service, according to reports.All to say, it will be worth watching how this unfolds. The new frontier is filled with opportunity, and having Apple on your side is a nice way to blaze a trail, or boldly go where no smartphones have gone before.On the S&P 500Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN): +24.78%SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG): +16.97%Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB): +15.57%Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL):15.24%Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc (NYSE:FCX).: +13.75%On the NASDAQ CompositeAmyris (NASDAQ:AMRS): +37.73%Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ:SAVA): 32.90%Pingtan Marine Enterprise (NASDAQ:PME): +26.08%Pacific Biosciences (NASDAQ:PACB): +25.75%Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT): +24.58%On the S&P 500Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY): -4.58%McCormick & Company Incorporated (NYSE:MKC): -3.80%Church & Dwight Company (NYSE:CHD): -3:11%CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF): -2.94%Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB): -2.79%On the NASDAQ CompositePlus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PSTV): -18.60%Newegg Commerce Inc (NASDAQ:NEGG): -16.78%Burcon NutraScience Corporation (NASDAQ:BRCN): -15.38%Cadiz Inc.

            "WeekAhead:StocksSetToResumeCorrectiveRallyOnTechnicalsWill investors maintain last week's return to risk as the Federal Reserve pushes its liquidation pedal harder this month? Investors will find that both stocks and bonds become heavier as the dollar supply shrinks, and given that the economy is already in a downturn, continued tightening increases the chances for a recession even the Biden Administration will find it difficult to deny.All four major U.S. averages gained for the first week in four, erasing the previous week's losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 4.9%. However, in terms of the decline from the week that started Aug. 15, the S&P 500 Index is beating its peers, down only 5%, paring the 8.3% decline as of the previous week. Conversely, the two worst performers remain the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 7.2% and 6.7%, respectively. This market paradigm is rational. Those last two are the most vulnerable when rates are on the rise. Investors are rotating out of big tech, which has maximized its return potential. They are dumping small companies, who don't have the resources and flexibility to deal with a tightening economy as large caps do.Let's dig deeper. Let's analyze the S&P 500 sectors. Consumer Discretionary surged 5.8%, the clear winner. However, in every other time frame: month, three months, six months, year to date, and yearly, Communication Services and its split conjoined twin, Technology, underperformed.But why will Technology outperform last week? Because the market flipped. The most stretched snapped back the hardest. Also, the dollar fell for the first week in four, after reaching a 20-year high and reaching levels against the yen not seen in 24 years. That 100% negative correlation is either a coincidence or causal.Given that a stronger dollar hurts American exports and foreign investments, there's reason to believe that a stronger dollar for the first three weeks weighed on equities and the weak dollar last week relieved that pressure. So, why would the dollar fall? Fedspeak was consistently pro further jump hikes, and rhetoric reiterated that inflation is still going strong and that policymakers will keep going for as long as necessary until they force inflation back down. In other words, there is no known fundamental reason for the dollar to back down, suggesting it declines in its haven status as investors increase risk.If there is no known fundamental reason, let's check out technical ones.SentimentThe sentiment indicator, the Levkovich Index - previously known as Citi's Panic/Euphoria model - dropped last week to 16, just one notch away from 17, considered a panic level. Bank of America's bull-and-bear gauge dropped to \"maximum bearish,\" egging on contrarian investors.Support and ResistanceSupport and resistance are functions of supply and demand. Chartists who follow trend lines create a self-fulfilled prophecy. Even fundamental analysts are humans. They remember that the price behaved in a certain way at a certain level, and that may influence an analyst's decision-making process.The following study of support and resistance I show you will probably represent the first time I have used it since the beginning of writing this column five and a half years and 2,313 articles ago - the Fibonacci indicator. I don't incorporate it into my analysis because I don't understand it. This mathematical sequence is found in many aspects of nature, and technicians, therefore, expect that it will also impact humans. I show it this time because it appears to be affecting the S&P 500 Index - consistently.S&P 500 Daily ChartSource: Investing.comThe bounce from the mid-June low to the mid-August high retraced to the 0.618 Fibonacci sequences (which coincided with the downtrend line), and last week's bounce retracted - that's right - from the 0.618 level. This measure is presumed to be the largest corrective move. If the price breaches it, the odds rise for a reversal. Interestingly, it may be a coincidence, but the gauge worked for the same level both ways. Perhaps Fibonacci followers are driving these moves. I have no other rational explanation.Either way, the price gapped above the 50- and 100-day moving averages, giving bulls an edge, suggesting the price has room for a further corrective rally to the downtrend line, reinforced with the 200 DMA. Still, you'd be going against the primary trend, which is risky.The dollar has fallen for three straight days for the first time in nearly a month, as some traders question whether the future hikes are already priced into the U.S. currency at a two-decade high. So, despite hawkish Fedspeak, this could be another reason why equities rally: the outlook of a weaker dollar. Let's look at the technicals.Dollar Index Daily ChartSource: Investing.comThe dollar is still very much in an uptrend. We can see how far it rose above its uptrend line, increasing the chances for a pullback. However, note that the greenback closed well off its lows on Friday, having found support by the July 14 high. Still, there is room for concern. Both the moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) and the relative strength index (RSI) indicators triggered negative correlations, increasing the chances for a further drop. Both also provided bearish crosses. However, as aforementioned, the dollar is still in an uptrend and has room for correction, having risen far away from its uptrend line.Gold bounced last week, in a mirror image of the dollar, having neared not its previous July low but the lowest levels since April 2020. However, the chart signals a warning.Gold Futures Daily ChartSource: Investing.comGold might be forming a second consecutive rising flag, bearish after the preceding $80, in a straight five-day line down - the telltale sign of a rising flag. A downside breakout will imply an $80 target. Note how both flags formed precisely on the downtrend line, with which the price has struggled since August.Gold Futures Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comIf that scenario follows through, gold will have breached its two-and-a-half-year support, topping out, implying another $400 drop.In another show of correlation with risk, rather than haven, assets, Bitcoin jumped 8.8% in its first rise in four weeks.Bitcoin Weekly ChartSource: Investing.comThe price found resistance by the bottom of a failed rising channel, as the 200-week MA pierced through it, which bumped head with the main falling channel. The 50-week MA fell below the 100 WMA. BTC is set to extend another down toward testing the 2020 lows.Oil rose Friday for the second straight day but was still down for the second week, closing weekly at the lowest since the week beginning Jan. 17.Crude Oil WTI Futures Daily ChartSource: Investing.comAfter completing a descending triangle, coinciding with a weekly death cross (when the 50 WMA falls below the 200 WMA, showing how pricing is breaking down broadly), the price bounced off the bottom of a falling channel, implying a continued spiral to $60 and below.Disclaimer: At the time of publication, the author had no positions in the securities mentioned.***Looking to get up to speed on your next idea?

            "StocksFaceFurtherLossesAsRatesSurgeYields have rocketed higher, and stocks have failed to keep pace with the surge. So despite the recent plunge in equity prices, indexes like the S&P 500 are more expensive today relative to bonds than before stock prices fell. It doesn't make one feel good now, does it?Looking at the spread between the S&P 500's earnings yield over the trailing twelve months and the current 10-year Treasury rate shows that the spread has contracted. That spread is now around 1.84% and the significantly lower end of its historical range of the past ten years.S&P/10-Year Yield SpreadEven more shocking is that the index has fallen by more than 8% since Aug. 16, yet the spread between the earnings yield and the 10-year is lower. In August, that spread was at 1.93%, which tells us that stocks today are more overvalued relative to bonds due to the speed at which yields have increased.On Aug.16, the 10-year rate was around 2.75%; now, it is trading around 3.3%, a massive move in a brief period. This would tell us that despite the sharp decline in the equity market, stocks haven't fully priced in higher yields and that stocks still need to fall further to account for the move higher in rates.S&P/10-Year Yield SpreadHow much lower should stocks fall, of course, becomes the next question. For that, we can turn and look at where the spreads were in June and July, and at that time, they were between 2.2% and 2.6%, and if we take the middle of 2.4%, stocks would need to reflect an earnings yield that is about 50 bps higher than today, assuming the 10-year rate is unchanged.That would push the earnings yield on the S&P 500 from around 5.15% today to about 5.65%, pushing the PE ratio from 19.4 to 17.7. Assuming earnings over the last twelve months of $204.91 would knock the value of the S&P 500 to 3,626 from its current 3,975, or a drop of about 9%.S&P Earnings YieldThe stocks that could get hurt the most in such a decline would be those that have seen their valuations rise or fall due to rates thus far. That would be stocks in the growth sector and many technology stocks or stocks that continue to carry high valuations in general.It seems easy to see that despite stocks falling since Jay Powell's Jackson Hole speech, the Fed isn't going to back off tightening monetary policy anytime soon. That should make stocks worth less versus bonds and not worth more. Given the enormous move in yields, one would expect stocks to reprice along with bonds, especially since the Fed has proven it will be more aggressive than the stock market had anticipated.Disclaimer: Charts used with the permission of Bloomberg Finance LP.

            "1StockToBuy,1StockToDumpThisWeek:Roblox,VirginGalacticStocks on Wall Street rallied on Friday, with the major indexes recording their first weekly gain in four weeks as investors continued to assess the path for inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in interest rate hikes.For the week, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.7%, while the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.6% and 4.1% respectively.Source: Investing.comFocus now shifts to U.S. inflation data due this coming week, with annual consumer prices expected to jump by 8.1% in August after an 8.5% rise in July.Producer prices, initial jobless claims and multiple manufacturing reports also are on the agenda.Elsewhere, on the earnings docket, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) headline a rather slow week for corporate results.Regardless of which direction the market goes, below we highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see further downside.Remember though, our time frame is just for the upcoming week.Stock To Buy: RobloxComing off its biggest weekly advance in three months, I expect Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) stock to extend its recovery in the week ahead as the digital entertainment company hosts a highly anticipated investor day event on Thursday, Sept. 15.Roblox founder and CEO David Baszucki will be joined by other members of the leadership team to present on the company’s long-term vision and path to profitability, as well as provide updates on key product features and technological innovations.In addition, CFO Michael Guthrie will present a financial overview that includes August monthly metrics.The presentations - which will be broadcast live on the Roblox YouTube channel starting at 12:00 P.M. ET - are to be followed by a live Q&A session.Last year, shares of the social-gaming platform soared 25% during the week of its investor day event after the company revealed plans to become a leader in the metaverse space.Roblox said last week that it will start displaying advertisements on its platform for the first time in 2023 as it seeks to diversify revenue beyond virtual goods in games.Roblox Daily ChartSource: Investing.comAfter soaring to a record peak of $141.60 in November 2021, RBLX stock sank to a low of $21.65 on May 10 as investors dumped unprofitable tech companies with expensive valuations amid the Fed’s aggressive rate hike plans.Shares have since rebounded by an astonishing 110% to end at $45.53 on Friday thanks to signs of increasing engagement on its gaming platform, which helped ease fears of a substantial slowdown in its core business.Despite the recent bounce, Roblox shares are still down about 56% year to date and are approximately 68% below their all-time high.At current valuations, the San Mateo, Calif.-based videogame firm, which allows users to easily develop games and interact in 3D virtual worlds, has a market cap of $27.2 billion.Stock To Dump: Virgin GalacticI believe Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) shares are set for a challenging week ahead, with a potential visit to new all-time lows on the horizon, due to the ongoing impact of several negative factors plaguing the struggling space-tourism pioneer.Galactic’s stock has been under heavy selling pressure ever since the company’s shock warning last month that it would postpone the start of commercial space voyages until mid-2023 amid a raft of spacecraft and regulatory issues.Earlier in the year, the space-tourism company had hoped to start commercial service for private citizens in Q1 2023. Initially, the company’s flights to space were set to begin at the end of 2021.In contrast, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin has already sent tourists to space aboard its New Shepard rocket six times through the end of last month.The long delay at Galactic has added to already-high uncertainty over the company’s quest to take tourists to space.It also fueled worries the company might need to raise more capital as it spends heavily to upgrade its existing spaceships and prepares to build even more.Galactic, which reported horrible second-quarter financial results in early August, ended the period with roughly $1.1 billion in cash and investments.Virgin Galactic Daily ChartSource: Investing.comSPCE stock closed at $6.00 on Friday, not far from its record trough of $5.14 touched on May 12.Year to date, Galactic shares are down 55.2%. Even more alarming, they stand 90% below their February 2021 all-time peak of $62.70 amid a potent combination of worsening fundamentals and a deteriorating macro backdrop.At current valuations, the Las Cruces, N.M.-based company has a market cap of $1.55 billion, despite losing money and generating little to no revenue as of yet.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Jesse had no position in any stock mentioned.

            "3Beaten-DownChinaStocksToBuyOnTheDipAsRegulatoryFearsFadeChinese companies have been some of the market’s worst performers over the past year, as they fell out of favor after Beijing launched a broad regulatory crackdown aimed at reining in the country’s tech sector in late 2020.The Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ), which is composed of securities of U.S-listed companies headquartered or incorporated in China, has tumbled approximately 67% since reaching an all-time high of $85.90 in February 2021.PGJ MonthlyNonetheless, the selloff has created attractive buy-the-dip opportunities. Here are three solid long-term investment opportunities with plenty of room to grow their respective businesses:Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has seen its valuation collapse as Beijing cracks down on tech companies with consumer-facing platforms in order to improve data privacy.After rallying to a record high of $319.32 in October 2020, BABA stock fell rapidly to a low of $73.28 on Mar. 15. After clawing back some losses, the shares still stand 72% below their all-time high.At current levels, the Hangzhou, China-based tech giant has a market cap of $239.8 billion, making it China's most valuable company.BABA DailyI expect Alibaba’s stock to extend its recovery as China’s regulatory clampdown eases and U.S. delisting fears recede.Wall Street still has a long-term bullish view on the stock, with 32 out of 33 analysts surveyed by Investing.com rating it as either a ‘buy’ or ‘hold’ with an average analyst price target of $127.92, representing an upside of 46.7%. The average fair value on InvestingPro+ is $142.59, a potential 59% upside.BABA Fair ValueDespite the year-long antitrust campaign, Alibaba has displayed ongoing strength in its core e-commerce business. Outside of its retail segment, cloud revenue has been another major growth driver as it tries to solidify its market position along with U.S. counterparts including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Despite fears over the damaging impact of regulatory scrutiny in Beijing and Washington, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) shares have held up better than local peers year-to-date, falling “just” 8.7%. BIDU shares have staged an impressive rebound in recent weeks, up 33.7% since reaching a 52-week low of $101.62 on May 12. However, BIDU remains nearly 62% below its February 2021 peak of $354.82.At current levels, Baidu has a valuation of $47.4 billion and is the fifth biggest tech company in China by market cap.BIDU DailyI believe further declines in Baidu’s stock may be limited as the worst of Beijing’s anti-tech regulatory campaign appears to be over and the tech behemoth aligns itself with the priorities of China President Xi Jinping.In another positive sign, Chinese and U.S. regulators have stepped up their efforts to reach an agreement and solve their years-long audit dispute so that Chinese firms can remain listed in the U.S.According to the Investing Pro+ model, BIDU stock has a fair value of approximately $188 a gain of 38%. Most analysts remain generally bullish on the Chinese internet giant, as per an Investing.com survey, which revealed that 21 out of 23 analysts covering the name rated it as a ‘buy’, with an average price target of $166.78.BIDU Fair ValueBaidu reported profit and revenue which blew past estimates when it reported second quarter numbers in late August. It has heavily diversified its business in recent years, expanding into cloud computing, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence.Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock has struggled in 2022 as China’s drastic measures to contain a resurgence in Covid cases limited electric vehicle (EV) output at its production factories and disrupted supply chains.Shares of the Guangzhou, China-based EV company, which are languishing near their lowest level on record, have underperformed the broader market by a wide margin year-to-date, losing 69% of their value. Even more alarming, XPEV stock is almost 80% away from its record peak of $74.49 reached in November 2020.At current levels, Xpeng has a valuation of $13.5 billion, making it the third largest electric vehicle maker in China in terms of market cap, trailing Nio (NYSE:NIO), and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI).XPEV DailyIn my view, Xpeng could be poised for a strong comeback amid indications that authorities in China will unleash fresh stimulus to support the economy in the near-term to combat the negative impact of its strict ‘zero-Covid’ policy. In addition, China said last month it would extend its tax exemption for new energy vehicle purchases until the end of 2023 in an effort to spur demand.In spite of the recent slide, Xpeng’s stock remains a favorite amongst Wall Street analysts, with 24 of 26 ratings collected by Investing.com reflecting a bullish recommendation. Among those surveyed, XPEV stock had whopping upside potential of 112.2% from Thursday’s closing price.Likewise, the quantitative models in InvestingPro+ point to a gain of 29.2% in XPEV stock over the next 12 months.XPEV Fair ValueThe automaker, which plans to begin deliveries of its new G9 SUV in October and launch two new models next year, delivered 90,085 vehicles through the first eight months of the year, representing a 96% year-over-year increase.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Jesse has no position in any stock mentioned.
